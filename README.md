## Data and models
The data set (Keum_HCV.xls) used for model calibration can be found in [Keum et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004278?via%3Dihub)

Model fitting and profile likelihood analysis have been performed by using the [Data2Dynamics toolbox]( https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/21/3558/195191) for the MATLAB environment and hence, the structure of model folders follows that toolbox structure. Please see for more information the GitHub page and all references within ([Data2Dynamics GitHub](https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d)).

In brief: [Download the toolbox]( https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d) and make sure to meet all [system requirements]( https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d/wiki/Installation) in order to run the models in Data2Dynamics. 

The folder structure for a model (SM Models) contains a *data*, *models* subfolder and *Setup* scripts. Run a particular model by executing the *Setup* script.
